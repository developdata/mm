      <h2>ABOUT THE IDEA</h2>
      <p>
        The musical medic is a fun way of exploring how we feel and how music makes us feel better. Doctors provide medicine, we prescribe music. In a relaxed way we hope to provide music that transforms your mood from a negative to a positive, or positive to an even more positive. Its fun to explore all the shades and directions of emotions through music.
      </p>
    

      <blockquote>"Nothing is better than music; when it takes us out of time, it has done more for us than we have the right to hope for: it has broadened the limits of our sorrowful life, it has lit up the sweetness of our hours of happiness by effacing the pettinesses that diminish us, bringing us back pure and new to what was, what will be, what music has created for us." - Nadia Boulanger</blockquote>
